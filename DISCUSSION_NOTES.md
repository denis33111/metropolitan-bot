# üìù **DISCUSSION NOTES - Metropolitan Bot Requirements**

## üéØ **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Goal:** Create a Telegram bot for Metropolitan Expo that provides **ADMIN** with check in/out data and allows **WORKERS** to contact admin.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The bot must be **EXTREMELY SIMPLE** and **UNDERSTANDABLE** for humans with **ZERO TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE** or **ZERO IQ** for technology.

## üéØ **REAL MAIN FUNCTIONALITY**

### **Primary Purpose:**
1. **Provide ADMIN with check in/out data** - Track who's working, when, where
2. **Enable WORKERS to contact ADMIN** - Get help, report issues, ask questions
3. **Monitor attendance compliance** - See who didn't follow the program

### **What the Bot Actually Does:**
- **For Workers:** Simple check-in/out + contact admin
- **For Admin:** Complete attendance data + worker communication
- **For Management:** Reports on who's following vs not following the program

### **Key Insight:**
This is **NOT** just an attendance tracker - it's an **ADMIN TOOL** that happens to have a simple worker interface.

## üè¢ **BUSINESS MODEL & SYSTEM WORKFLOW**

### **Company Structure:**
- **Company 1 (Metropolitan Expo):** Provides workers to Company 2
- **Company 2 (Client):** Receives workers and provides weekly program
- **Workers:** Employed by Company 1, work at Company 2 locations

### **Weekly Program Workflow:**
```
1. MID-WEEK (Wednesday/Thursday):
   - Company 2 tells Company 1: "We need X workers for next week"
   - Company 2 provides: Worker requirements, dates, times, locations

2. END OF WEEK (Friday):
   - Company 1 creates FINAL PROGRAM based on Company 2's requirements
   - Final program includes: Which workers, when, where, what times

3. NEXT WEEK:
   - Workers follow the FINAL PROGRAM
   - Bot monitors compliance with Company 1's final program
   - Bot reports to Company 1 admin about worker compliance
```

### **What This Means for the Bot:**
- **Bot works for Company 1** (Metropolitan Expo)
- **Bot monitors Company 1's workers** at Company 2 locations
- **Program sheet contains Company 1's final program** (not Company 2's initial request)
- **Admin is Company 1 management** (not Company 2)
- **Reports go to Company 1** about their workers' performance

## üß† **USER EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Target Users:**
- **Workers with ZERO technical knowledge**
- **People who struggle with basic apps**
- **Users who get confused by complex interfaces**
- **Anyone who finds technology overwhelming**

### **Design Principles:**
- **KISS:** Keep It Super Simple
- **One button = One action**
- **No confusing menus or options**
- **Clear, simple language only**
- **Visual cues and emojis everywhere**
- **Step-by-step guidance only**
- **No technical jargon ever**

## üèóÔ∏è **CURRENT STATUS**

‚úÖ **Bot Connection:** Working (empty_bot.py)  
‚úÖ **Google Sheet:** Created with structure  
‚úÖ **Environment:** Basic config ready  
‚ùå **Functionality:** Zero - ready to build  

## üìä **GOOGLE SHEET STRUCTURE**

**Sheet Name:** "metropolitan"  
**Columns:**
- **A: ID** ‚Üí Telegram ID (automatic from bot)
- **B: NAME** ‚Üí Worker's full name
- **C: PHONE** ‚Üí Worker's phone number  
- **D: STATUS** ‚Üí ACTIVE/INACTIVE (working or not)

**Program Sheet (New):**
**Sheet Name:** "PROGRAM" or "SCHEDULE"  
**Purpose:** Metropolitan Expo's (Company 1) FINAL PROGRAM for workers at Company 2 locations

**Columns:**
- **A: WORKER_NAME** ‚Üí Worker's name (from Metropolitan Expo)
- **B: DATE** ‚Üí Work date (next week)
- **C: START_TIME** ‚Üí Expected start time (e.g., "09:00")
- **D: END_TIME** ‚Üí Expected end time (e.g., "17:00")
- **E: LOCATION** ‚Üí Company 2 work location
- **F: STATUS** ‚Üí SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, MISSED

**Program Management Workflow:**
```
1. MID-WEEK: Company 2 sends requirements to Metropolitan Expo (us)
2. FRIDAY: Metropolitan Expo admin updates PROGRAM sheet with final assignments
3. NEXT WEEK: Bot monitors workers against Metropolitan Expo's final program
4. DAILY: Bot reports compliance to Metropolitan Expo admin
```

**Program Update Process:**
- **Source:** Google Sheets (manual entry by Metropolitan Expo admin)
- **Frequency:** Every Friday for next week
- **Method:** Admin manually updates PROGRAM sheet in Google Sheets
- **Bot Action:** Bot automatically reads updated program and starts monitoring

**Location Details:**
- **Work Location:** Same Company 2 location (not multiple locations)
- **Zone:** 500m radius from fixed Company 2 coordinates
- **Coordinates:** Already in .env file (37.924917, 23.931444)

**Weekly Schedule Handling:**
- **Manual:** Admin manually creates new weekly program every Friday
- **Bot Role:** Bot reads program and monitors compliance
- **No Automation:** Bot doesn't create or rollover programs automatically

**Practical Weekly Example:**
```
WEDNESDAY (Mid-week):
- Company 2 calls: "We need 5 workers next week: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM"

FRIDAY (Program Creation):
- Metropolitan Expo admin opens Google Sheets
- Updates PROGRAM sheet with next week's assignments:
  Row 1: John Smith | Monday | 09:00 | 17:00 | Company2_Office | SCHEDULED
  Row 2: Maria Garcia | Monday | 09:00 | 17:00 | Company2_Office | SCHEDULED
  Row 3: Alex Johnson | Tuesday | 09:00 | 17:00 | Company2_Office | SCHEDULED
  ... (continues for the week)

MONDAY (Bot Monitoring):
- Bot reads PROGRAM sheet
- Sees John and Maria should work at 09:00
- Waits until 09:10 (10 min latency)
- If John/Maria didn't check in by 09:10
- Bot alerts Metropolitan Expo admin: "‚ö†Ô∏è John and Maria didn't check in by 09:10"
```

**Business Purpose:**
The bot makes communication between Metropolitan Expo (us) and our workers faster and easier, so we can provide better service to Company 2.

## üîî **AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION SYSTEM**

### **Program-Based Monitoring:**
1. **Bot reads program sheet** - Gets today's scheduled workers and times
2. **Monitors check-ins** - Tracks who checked in vs who should have
3. **10-minute latency** - Waits 10 minutes after scheduled start time
4. **Automatic admin alerts** - Notifies admin of missing workers

### **Notification Logic:**
```
Example:
- John scheduled to work at 09:00
- Bot waits until 09:10 (10 min latency)
- If John hasn't checked in by 09:10
- Bot automatically sends admin: "‚ö†Ô∏è John didn't check in by 09:10 (scheduled 09:00)"
```

### **What Gets Monitored:**
- **Scheduled start times** - Who should be working when
- **Actual check-ins** - Who actually showed up
- **Missing workers** - Who didn't follow the program
- **Late arrivals** - Who checked in after scheduled time

## üöÄ **SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**

### **Work Zone:**
- **Radius:** 500 meters from office
- **Office Coordinates:** 37.924917, 23.931444 (from .env)
- **Purpose:** Workers must be within zone to check in/out

### **Worker Management:**
- **Registration:** New workers go through onboarding flow
- **Identification:** Uses Telegram ID as unique identifier
- **Status Tracking:** ACTIVE (working) vs INACTIVE (not working)

## üîÑ **COMPLETE WORKFLOW DESIGN**

### **Phase 1: Worker Registration Flow**
```
1. New worker starts bot (/start)
2. Bot detects new vs existing worker
3. Bot asks for full name
4. Bot asks for phone number
5. Bot saves to Google Sheet: [Telegram_ID, NAME, PHONE, ACTIVE]
6. Registration complete - worker can now use check-in/out
```

### **Phase 2: Working Flow (Zone-Based)**
```
1. Worker sends location (GPS coordinates)
2. Bot checks if within 500m work zone
3. Check-in: Records start time + location + sets status
4. Check-out: Records end time + location + updates status
5. Status tracking: Shows current work status
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

- Prevent remote check-ins
- Log all location data

## üì± **USER EXPERIENCE FLOW**

### **New Worker Journey (SUPER SIMPLE):**
```
1. Worker finds bot on Telegram
2. Sends /start (or just types "start")
3. Bot shows: "Hi! What's your name? (just type it)"
4. Worker types: "John Smith"
5. Bot shows: "Great! What's your phone number? (just type it)"
6. Worker types: "1234567890"
7. Bot shows: "Perfect! You're registered! üéâ"
8. Bot shows: "Now you can work! Just press these buttons:"
   [‚úÖ START WORK] [üö™ END WORK] [üìä MY STATUS] [üìû CONTACT ADMIN]
```

### **Daily Work Flow (SUPER SIMPLE):**
```
1. Worker arrives at office
2. Presses [‚úÖ START WORK] button
3. Bot shows: "Share your location üìç (press the location button)"
4. Worker presses location button
5. Bot shows: "Great! You're at work! ‚úÖ"
6. Worker works...
7. Worker presses [üö™ END WORK] button
8. Bot shows: "Share your location üìç (press the location button)"
9. Worker presses location button
10. Bot shows: "Work day finished! üëã"
```

### **Admin Workflow (Monitoring & Management):**
```
1. Admin sends /admin
2. Bot shows admin panel:
   [üìä TODAY'S REPORT] [üë• ALL WORKERS] [‚ùå MISSING WORKERS] [üìû CONTACT WORKER]

3. Admin presses [üìä TODAY'S REPORT]
4. Bot shows: "Today's Program Report: 15 scheduled, 12 checked in, 3 missing"

5. Admin presses [‚ùå MISSING WORKERS]
6. Bot shows: "Workers who didn't follow today's program:"
   "John Smith - Scheduled 09:00, didn't check in by 09:10"
   "Maria Garcia - Scheduled 08:30, didn't check in by 08:40"
   "Alex Johnson - Scheduled 09:00, didn't check in by 09:10"

7. Admin presses [üìû CONTACT WORKER]
8. Bot shows: "Which worker? (type name)"
9. Admin types: "John"
10. Bot shows: "Message for John: (type your message)"
11. Bot sends message to John: "Admin needs to talk to you"
```

### **Automatic Admin Notifications:**
```
Bot automatically sends admin when workers miss program:

"‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING WORKER ALERT ‚ö†Ô∏è
John Smith didn't check in by 09:10
Scheduled start time: 09:00
Current time: 09:10
Status: MISSING"

"‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING WORKER ALERT ‚ö†Ô∏è
Maria Garcia didn't check in by 08:40
Scheduled start time: 08:30
Current time: 08:40
Status: MISSING"
```

### **Worker Contact Admin Flow:**
```
5. Admin gets notification: "John Smith: I'm sick today, can't come to work"
```

### **Key Simplifications:**
- **No commands to remember** - Just buttons
- **No typing required** - Just press buttons
- **Clear visual feedback** - ‚úÖ ‚ùå üéâ üëã
- **Simple language only** - "Press this button"
- **One action at a time** - Never overwhelm user
- **Always show next step** - "Now do this..."
